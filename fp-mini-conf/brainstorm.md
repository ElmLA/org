# Let's plan a mini-conf!

This is a living doc for us to think through stuff and put our thoughts down.

## Some things we should probably figure out

- [ ] When?: conf planning & marketing takes a bit of time, so we should probably give ourselves at least 2 months lead time (will also need to consider holidays, etc.)
- [ ] Where?: dependent on several factors like: expected attendee size, accomodations needed, etc.
- [ ] Who?: Who are we doing this for and how do we reach them so they know about this event and will come? What is our target attendee size? How will we manage registrations (do we need to)?
  - This is going to be a huge challenge and should not get left behind with all the fun technical content
- [ ] What?: What's our goal in putting this on? What content will we offer? (Workshops? Talks? Both?) Who will lead these activities? If we're doing talks, where will we source them and are the speakers reflective of the communities we're trying to serve?
  - If we have workshops, should it be a single long workshop? Multiple shorter ones sequentially? Multiple shorter ones in parallel?
- [ ] Accomodations for attendees
  - [ ] Food? Do we need a food sponsor?
  - [ ] Code of Conduct
  - [ ] Accessibility: facilities should be ADA accessible (and _actually_ accessible), will there be coverage for folks who have child care needs?, are there bathrooms for everyone?, etc.
- [ ] Process: how often should we sync and how do we sync up?
  - Who else do we want to include in the planning/organizing?
  - How do we decide what's being presented?

## Resources / inspo

- [BridgeTroll](https://www.bridgetroll.org/) - lists all the different bridge events. They even provide a list of recommendations for planning that is waaaaay more inclusive of my sloppy notes above! [WorkshopCookbook](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/WorkshopCookbook/wiki/Cookbook)
