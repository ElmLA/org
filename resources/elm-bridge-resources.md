**Elm resources & information from ElmBridge:**

- ElmBridge curriculum: [https://elmbridge.github.io/curriculum/](https://elmbridge.github.io/curriculum/) - this is the main curriculum that we were following today, which includes links to the code we were working with.  The curriculum is open-sourced and maintained by Elm community organizers around the world; you're very encouraged to contribute to it!
- ElmCamp tutorial: [bit.ly/elm-camp](http://bit.ly/elm-camp) - a tutorial which goes through making API requests and parsing JSON (it's still a work in process so it's way less fleshed out than the main curriculum, but we're in the process of updating it to make it more amenable to self-paced learning); also links to tons of learning resources as well.
