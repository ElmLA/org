# Action items in advance of our first meetup!

We're about a week away from our first Elm LA Meetup, woohoo!

Currently, we have **38 people RSVPed**.  It's been my experience that you get around half of the RSVPs in attendance so I think right now we're looking at around 20 people.

Many of them responded to the RSVP question that they considered themselves beginners (little to no experience) with Elm.

For next week, Second Spectrum will be ordering food & drinks for attendees.

## TODOs

* [ ] Decide on who's giving the 15-min intro talk; [see the poll to vote](https://elmlang.slack.com/files/U5BH6QXTJ/F81C85UBH/Poll_for_15_min_talk_for_12_5_meetup).
* [ ] Someone to emcee the event (explain the agenda, mention the CoC, lead ice breaker / working groups forming, facilitate wrap-up)
* [ ] Look over CoC; this will likely be a work in progress as we continue to understand the needs of our group, but would be nice to get eyes on it before next week.
* [x] For the beginners group, there will be a split between:
  * [x] People with zero Elm experience (and some may have zero front-end experience) [Emma to facilitate]
  * [x] People with little Elm experience [Zach to facilitate]
* [x] For the intermediate to expert levels, we may not need to do much facilitation there, but it would be nice to have someone get to know that group and understand what they'd like to get out of future events. [Luke to facilitate]
* [ ] On the venue logistics side, Second Spectrum needs to:
  * [ ] Order food & setup the space
  * [x] Make sure we have nametags available (**what do we think about having people list their preferred pronouns on their nametags?** We do this at Write/Speak/Code and it helps a lot with not misgendering folks or making assumptions.)
  * [ ] Set up AV so we can record the intro [Emma will follow up]
    * [ ] **Where should we post the recorded video?** Could set up an Elm LA youtube channel for all recordings
* Anything else?
